/**
 *  Write code that reads a series of test scores (as integers) from the user until the user

 *  tell them to re-enter the value. Keep track of the number of passing and failing test grades. Assume 
 *  that a failing grade is below a 60. When the user enters '-1', print out the number of passing and failing students.
